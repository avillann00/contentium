# Contentium

This is the official repository for the app [Contentium](https://contentium.vercel.app/) 

This app aims to offer personalized management and suggestions for content creators.

### Frontend

Features:
- The frontend will contain a friendly use dashboard that allows the user to easily view all of their connected accounts in one place.
- I will also use OAuth and JWT Tokens for a safe user experience.

For the frontend I am using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) .

I am also using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the frontend.

### Backend

Features:
- The backend will handle all of the information to and from the front end.

For the backend I am using [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) .

I am also using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)  to host the backend.

### Database

Features:
- The database will store all information to be queried for later use.

For the database I am using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 

I am also using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)  to host the database.
